===ThoughtBubbleSpawn===
You continue to think over your options for a new creature, you wonder and ponder and ponder some more, you really are indecisive aren't you? Eventually you notice something, youâ€™ve already created the creature! You look above you and see a white bubble with three black dots on it, you somehow accidentally created a thought bubble as a creature. The thought bubble drops down on you and attacks.
-> DONE
